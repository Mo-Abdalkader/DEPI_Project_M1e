# **Lung and Colon Cancer Detection Using Histopathological Images**

This repository contains the AI components for a **lung and colon cancer image classification model**. The project aims to classify histopathological images as benign or cancerous using deep learning models, including custom CNNs and transfer learning. The best-performing model is deployed via a Flask web application for real-time predictions.

## **Project Phases**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
To prepare the dataset for training, we performed the following preprocessing steps:
- **Image Resizing**: All images were resized from 768x768 to **200x200 pixels** to reduce computation time while preserving critical image details.
- **Normalization**: The pixel values were normalized to a range of **[0, 1]** to maintain uniformity across the images.
- **Data Augmentation**: Various techniques such as **rotation**, **flipping**, **zoom**, and **shifting** were applied to enhance the model's generalization capability and prevent overfitting.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: We created a grayscale version of the dataset to test models with grayscale inputs alongside RGB models.

### **2. Model Development**
Several models were developed for this project, ranging from custom-built CNNs to transfer learning models:

- **Custom CNN Models**:  
  Two custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were developed:
  - One CNN for **grayscale images** to test performance without color information.
  - Another CNN for **RGB images**, using color data for more complex feature extraction.

- **Transfer Learning Models**:  
  Pre-trained model, such as **DenseNet**, were fine-tuned on the dataset. Both grayscale and RGB versions were trained. Transfer learning allowed us to leverage pre-learned features and achieve better performance with fewer training epochs.

### **3. Model Training and Evaluation**
- **Training**: All models were trained using cross-entropy loss and the **Adam optimizer** to speed up convergence. 
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - We evaluated the models using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**, providing a comprehensive view of model performance.
- **Best Performing Model**: 
  - The **DenseNet model trained on RGB images** produced the best results, with the highest accuracy and strong generalization capabilities.

**Confusion matrices** were generated to analyze classification accuracy for each class and to identify areas for improvement.

### **4. Deployment**
The best-performing model was deployed using **Flask** to create an easy-to-use web interface for healthcare professionals:
- **Flask Web Application**:  
  The web app allows users to upload histopathological images and receive real-time predictions on whether the tissue is benign or cancerous. The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

### Results
The performance of the models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Below are the results for the various models tested:

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| CNN (Gray)           | 96%      | 90%       | 99%    |
| CNN (Colored)        | 98%      | 97%       | 98%    |
| DenseNet (Gray)      | 99%      | 98%       | 99%    |
| DenseNet (Colored)   | 98%      | 96%       | 97%    |

These results highlight the effectiveness of the models in classifying the input data based on the evaluated metrics.
